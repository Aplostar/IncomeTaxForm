# IncomeTaxForm
The digital implementation of income tax form.

This was my first ever project implemented in 2015. It consists of a C++03 version code for the income tax form with an easily accesible GUI.
It also contained various easter eggs like a calculator and all number conversions consisting of binary, decimal, octal and hexadecimal numbers.

The functionalities used in this project were Graphics in C++, Basic Data Structures like linked lists, stacks and queues and Concepts of File Handling. It would need some tweaking to get it running again due to the change in syntax since then.
